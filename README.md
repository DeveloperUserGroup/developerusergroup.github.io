#Normal dev
- `npm start` will get everything up and running. The server and all the transpilers.
  - there is a weird bug I haven't solved where you need to hit enter once the transpilers start up for the server to start

#first runs
- `bundle install` - make sure you have jekyll & ruby installed
- `npm install`

#Notes
If you update bootstrap, run `npm run copy`
