<h1>Sponsorship</h1>

<p>We limit ourselves to four key sponsors of the Developer User Group per year so that we can give enough time to each sponsor without overloading our attendees. Our key sponsors gain the following privileges:
<ul>
    <li>Regular tweets of sponsor activities</li>
    <li>Invites to speaker dinners.</li>
    <li>Sponsor logo on the sponsor slide displayed to the group before the event starts</li>
    <li>Sponsor pull up banner placed in the event room</li>
    <li>Sponsor thanked by committee at each event</li>
    <li>Sponsor logo displayed on DeveloperUG website</li>
</ul>

Key sponsorship costs R35 000. If you are interested in sponsoring DevUG, please <a href="mailto:admin@developerug.org.za?Subject=I want to sponsor">email us</a>.
</p>

<h2>Employment / Vacancies</h2>

<p>If you have employment positions available that you would like to fill we suggest you use
    <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stack Overflow's careers site</a> or
    <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OfferZen</a></a>. </p>

<p>Alternatively you can sponsor swag (i.e. things to give away) for an event. The minimum value of the swag should be R5 000 and should be no more than
    5 items, at which point we will make brief mention of the vacant position at our next meeting and advise an URL that interested
    members can visit. If you are interested in this option please <a href="/about">contact the organisers.</a></p>

<h2>Conferences / Courses </h2>

<p>If you have a conference / course that you would like to advertise and the organisers deem it appropriate for the group we
    would require one ticket be made available to the group for a lucky draw at the next Meetup.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can sponsor swag for an event (the minimum value of the swag should be R5 000 and should be no more than
    5 items) at which point we will make brief mention of the event at our next meeting and advise a URL that interested
    members can visit. If you are interested in this option please
    <a href="/about">contact the organizers</a>.</p>

<p>The organisers may decide to skip this requirement for conferences or courses which are run by the community.</p> 

<h2>What do you do with this money?</h2>

<p>That is a great question, the money for the group goes to the following areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As a registered non-profit and tax work that is needed and we hire a tax consulant for this.</li>
    <li>The group has has a part time assistant who helps with logistical management which greatly helps the group keep running smooth.</li>
    <li>The group uses some money for small tokens of appreciation for speakers - it isn't easy to get up in front of an audience!</li>
    <li>The group uses money to cover travel and expenses of speakers we bring from other parts of the country to speak at the events.</li>
    <li>Running costs for our website, email and document sharing.</li>
    <li>Costs for storage of banners and other material.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we don't use the money for is also worth noting:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No profit is taken and none of the organisers are paid.</li>
    <li>No speaker fees are paid.</li>
</ul>
