<h1>Sponsorship</h1>

<p>We limit ourselves to four key sponsors of the Developer User Group per year so that we can give enough time to each
    sponsor without overloading our attendees. Our key sponsors gain the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>Sponsor logo on the sponsor and thank you at start of the session</li>
    <li>Sponsor logo displayed on DeveloperUG website</li>
    <li>Dedicated email to our entire email list of over 1600 developers</li>
</ul>

Key sponsorship costs R15 000. If you are interested in sponsoring DevUG, please <a
    href="mailto:admin@developerug.org.za?Subject=I want to sponsor">email us</a>.
</p>

<h2>Employment / Vacancies</h2>

<p>If you have employment positions available that you would like to fill we suggest you use
    <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stack Overflow's careers
        site</a> or
    <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OfferZen</a></a>.
</p>

<p>Alternatively you can sponsor swag (i.e. things to give away) for an event. The minimum value of the swag must be
    R5 000, at which point we will make brief mention of the vacant position at our next meeting and advise a URL that
    interested
    members can visit. If you are interested in this option please <a target="_blank"
        href="/mailto:admin@developerug.org.za?Subject=I post a job">contact the organisers.</a></p>

<h2>Conferences / Courses </h2>

<p>For paid conferences or courses that you would like to advertise would require one ticket be made available to the
    group for a lucky draw at the next meet up.</p>
<p>For free community conferences or courses, these can be advertised for free.</p>
<p>Note: all advertising is at the discretion of the organisers.</p>

<h2>What do you do with this money?</h2>

<p>That is a great question, the money for the group goes to the following areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As a registered non-profit and tax work that is needed, and we hire a tax consultant for this.</li>
    <li>The group has a part-time assistant who helps with logistical management which greatly helps the group keep
        running smooth.</li>
    <li>The group uses some money for small tokens of appreciation for speakers - it isn't easy to get up in front of an
        audience!</li>
    <li>The group uses money to cover travel and expenses of speakers we bring from other parts of the country to speak
        at the events.</li>
    <li>Running costs for our website, email and document sharing.</li>
    <li>Costs for storage of banners and other material.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we don't use the money for is also worth noting:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No profit is taken and none of the organisers are paid.</li>
    <li>No speaker fees are paid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>We have two other options that may appeal to you too</p>
<ol>
    <li>Each December, we run our Geek of the Year and are always looking for prize sponsors</li>
    <li>In Johannesburg and Cape Town, we run an annual conference <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.devconf.co.za">DevConf</>,
            which
            has amazing sponsorship options.</li>
</ol>
