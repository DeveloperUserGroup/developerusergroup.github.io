    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The developer user group started in 2010 when Mark Pearl & Terence Kruger launched the Programming Languages User Group. Over time the group evolved to be about more than just programming languages and was renamed the Developer User Group.</p>
    <p>The Johannesburg Developer User Group has been hosted by Microsoft since 2012 and was a launch partner in their Community Nights initiative.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the Developer User Group officially became a non-profit organisation.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Terence Kruger & Botha van der Vyver launched the Pretoria chapter of the group, which has been hosted by Momentum ever since.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the Cape Town chapter of the user group was launched.</p>

    <h1>Organisers</h1>
    <p>DevUG is run by a team of volunteers and assistants. Without their hard work it would not be possible for the group to exist.</p>
