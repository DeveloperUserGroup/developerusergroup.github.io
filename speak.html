        <p>EVERYONE is welcome to speak at DevUG! We welcome all levels of people who want to speak and will gladly
            assist you in becoming the next great presenter!</p>
        <p>We do require that content be relevant to software developers, but that does not mean it is limited to
            software development. Talks on other topics that impact the lives of developers are equally welcome.</p>
        <p>Talks must conform to our <a href="/coc">Code of Conduct</a>. Marketing talks or sales pitches are not
            welcome. You are welcome to mention where you work and if you are hiring but just a mention; the talk should
            be about the content, not hiring or selling.</p>
        <p>To get started, just <a href="mailto:admin@developerug.org.za">contact us directly</a> or complete the form
            below!</p>
