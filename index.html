<h1>Welcome Friend</h1>
<p>The Developer User Group is a South African group of like minded software developers who meet monthly in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town.</p>
<p>The groups meetings are free and open to all, regardless of experience or background. Our monthly meetings are also free thanks to our generous sponsors. Our group also runs adhoc special events which bring workshops and special events to South Africa.</p>
<p>We are welcoming to all who wish to present, so if you are experienced or a first time presenter we would be honoured to work with you.</p>
<h2>The Developer User Group Principals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We are run by the community, for the benefit of the community.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a safe space and leads in inclusion and awareness of issues in the South African developer ecosystem.</li>
    <li>We are technology agnostic. This is a place for all involved in software to share about their technologies and tools.</li>
    <li>We are vendor neutral. We do not support any vendor or company. While do do have sponsors, they do not dictate or influence the group in anyway.</li>
    <li>We believe that collaboration and discussion improves all involved.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a true non-profit organisation.</li>
