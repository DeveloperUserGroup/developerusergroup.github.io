    <h1>Welcome, Friend</h1>
    <p>
      The Developer User Group is a South African group of like-minded software developers who meet monthly in
      Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groups' meetings open to all, regardless of experience or background, and free to attend thanks to our
      generous sponsors. Our group also runs ad hoc events to bring workshops and special presenters to the South African
      developer community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are welcoming to all who wish to present, so whether you are experienced or a first time presenter, we would be
      honoured to work with you.

  <h2>The Developer User Group Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are run by the community, for the benefit of the community.</li>
    <li>
      The Developer User Group is a safe space and leads with inclusion and awareness of issues in the South African
      developer ecosystem.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are technology-agnostic. This is a place for anyone involved in software to share about their technologies,
      practices and tools.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are vendor neutral. We do not support any vendor or company. While we do have sponsors, they do not dictate or
      influence the group in any way.
    </li>
    <li>We believe that collaboration and discussion offers everyone involved the opportunity to improve.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a true non-profit organisation.</li>
  </ul>
