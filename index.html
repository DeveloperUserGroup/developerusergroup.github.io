        <h1>Welcome, Friend</h1>
        <p>The Developer User Group is a South African group of like-minded software developers who meet monthly in Johannesburg, Pretoria
            and Cape Town.</p>
        <p>The groups' meetings open to all, regardless of experience or background, and free to attend thanks to our generous sponsors.
            Our group also runs adhoc events to bring workshops and special presenters to the South African developer community.</p>
        <p>We are welcoming to all who wish to present, so whether you are experienced or a first time presenter, we would be honoured
            to work with you.</p>

<h2>The Developer User Group Principles</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We are run by the community, for the benefit of the community.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a safe space and leads with inclusion and awareness of issues in the South African developer
        ecosystem.</li>
    <li>We are technology agnostic. This is a place for anyone involved in software to share about their technologies, practices
        and tools.</li>
    <li>We are vendor neutral. We do not support any vendor or company. While we do have sponsors, they do not dictate or influence
        the group in any way.</li>
    <li>We believe that collaboration and discussion offers everyone involved the opportunity to improve.</li>
    <li>The Developer User Group is a true non-profit organisation.</li>
</ul>
