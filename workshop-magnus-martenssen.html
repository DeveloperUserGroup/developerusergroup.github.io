<h2>About the Workshop</h2>

<p>You are at the Cloud cross roads and want to be effective using Azure! You want to grab this opportunity, 
have a good direction and speed of ascent. When going to the Cloud, many things remain the same. Other key 
things are new and have changed quite a bit. You hesitate. You feel uncertain and unfamiliar, or you are 
frustrated and confused. Many have been where you are. Some have taken this course.</p>

<p><i>“I wish someone had told me the secrets of Azure before we started two years ago! This course is spot on 
things we now apply successfully every day in our Azure solutions. We are more goal oriented when using the 
Cloud. Ultimately this saves us money and makes working with Cloud more tangible and much more fun.” 
– Brian Jensen, workshop attendee, Denmark</i></p>

they want? How do I set up to divide the bill between departments and environments? How do we stay compliant 
and restrict to appropriate locations and services? How do I handle access to Cloud resources in an effective 
way? How do I monitor resources when they are running – is the site up and is it successful? And “who’s database 
is this”, because it is costing us money? Avoid confusion and hesitation! Measure effectiveness, speed and 
success! This course is Your booster pack!</p>

<p><i>“Regardless if you are new to the Cloud, or if you have been in there for years most companies, developers
